## Project First Part

In this project initially, we had to create a logo and website to put the work of multiple deadlines.

## Project Second Part

In the second part of this project, we had to develop a mobile or desktop app, with the goal of creating an app as the most friendly user and as simple as possible. Our group decided to go with an Android mobile app made in Android Studio.
