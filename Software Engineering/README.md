The goal of this project was to create a system that makes possible submit papers, create conferences, log in and multiple other functionalities. To create this system we guided by EASYCHAIR https://easychair.org/ platform.

    - In this course, we had to develop one project in groups of three students with two phases.
    - The language used was UML.
    
 ## Project First Phase
 
- Gantt Diagram with all project planning.
- Requirements elicitation (KAOS).
    - Identify goals and agents
    - Define non-functional goals.
    - Identify obstáculos problems e solutions.
    - Identify Objects and operations.
- Requirements analysis (KAOS).
    - Choosing the object-oriented (OO) paradigm for modeling.
    - Map the Eligible Requirements Model (KAOS) for UML Models.
    
  ## Project Second Phase
  
- Correct First Phase.
- Architectural design (Package and component diagrams).
- Specify test cases
- Variability modeling.
- Develop a Prototype
    - To develop a prototype we had to choose five full functionalities of the system to implement in a website.
