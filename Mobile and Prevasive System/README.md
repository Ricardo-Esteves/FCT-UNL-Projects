    - In this course, we had to develop one projects in groups of three students.
    - The language used was Java and Arduino.

In this course, we will make one big project that consists in implementing a complete system to open a door, 
with the possibility to open a door remotely. To make this interaction possible we will use a remote communication between the mobile device(s) and the controller, using WiFi.

## Smart Door (Project)

* Make an Android App with the purpose of integrating with a door opening system.
